# Meter Tariffs

The application allows you to enter your historical, current and, if known, future tariff rates for your Gas and Electricity meters. This enables the application to calculate your historical, current and future energy costs. 

## Editing Tariffs

The tariffs can be the standard Unit-Rate plus Standing-Charge, or Time-of-Use tariffs, such as Economy 7 or Economy 10 offered by some energy providers. For Time-of-Use tariffs, you must enter the rate for each hour of the day - it's not possible to simply set a day and night rate if you're on Economy 7, for example.

Tariffs can be accessed from the Setup page, for each meter on the Meter Setup table, by clicking the *Tariffs* button. This will navigate to the Tariffs page for that meter, where historical, current and future tariffs can be viewed and edited.

This page displays a table of all historical, and future tariff rates for this meter, sorted by date. The 'Applies From' header indicates when the tariff rate was applicable from, until the next row's 'Applies From' date. The last row's 'Applies From' date will apply that tariff rate for all dates after that date.

When a meter is added, default tariff rates are added, from 2021 to the present. In the UK, since the Energy Price Cap and Energy Price Guarantee meant that most standard tariffs were the same for all energy providers from mid-2021 and throughout 2022 and into 2023, the default tariff rates are likely to be accurate for most users for this period. However recently energy prices have decreased, and the default rates may differ from your actual tariff rates, so if you want to ensure the analysis energy costs are accurate, you should check and update the recent tariff rates if necessary.

You can add a new Tariff Period by clicking the *blue plus icon* at the top of the table, or edit an existing tariff period by clicking the *Edit* button on the table row. Both will open the Tariff Period dialogue, where you can add or edit the date the tariff rate applies from, and the Unit Rate and Standing Charge standard 'fixed' tariff rates, or the 24-hourly rates for Time-of-Use tariffs.
