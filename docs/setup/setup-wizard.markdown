# Setup Wizard

The setup wizard covers all the required steps to enable the application to retrieve and analyse your smart meter data, in a single flow. It's possible to skip either Electricity or Gas meter setup, if one of them is not required or available. If you only have a Gas smart meter, you can skip the Electricity Meter setup, and vice versa.

The setup wizard proceeds as follows:  Household -> Gas Meter -> Gas Meter Authorization -> Electricity Meter -> Electricity Meter Authorization -> Final Summary.
 
The setup wizard is available from the home page. <img src="../assets/img/setup/SetupWizardIcon.png" alt="Setup Wizard Icon" width="100" height="25">

All the wizard does is wrap the setup stages into a single flow. You can navigate directly to the more manual *Setup* page from the main menu, where all the setup options are also available.
