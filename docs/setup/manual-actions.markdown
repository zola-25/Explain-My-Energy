# Manual Actions

This page outlines some of the manual actions available related to updating, reloading and deleting data.

## Wipe All Data

As explained in the warning popup, this will delete all your data saved in your browser, including your household details, meter readings, weather data, tariff rates and any other data stored in the application.

It will reset the application to its initial state, and you will need to re-enter your household details and re-authorize your meters. You will be redirected to the initial Welcome page.


## Removing Meters

You can remove a meter from the application by clicking the *Remove Meter* button on the Meter Setup table on the Setup page. This will remove the meter from the application, and delete all meter readings for this meter, as well as any custom tariff rates you have entered for this meter.

## Update or Reload Meter Readings

Whenever you refresh the application, or launch it from a new browser session, the application should automatically retrieve the latest meter readings from your smart meter(s) that you have setup and authorized. If for any reason this process fails, you can manually update, or completely reload the meter readings for an individual meter, by clicking either *Update Meter Readings* or *Reload Meter Readings*. 

Reloading the meter readings will delete all existing readings for this meter and replace them with the available readings from n3rgy.

Updating the meter readings will only add new readings to the existing readings for this meter, and will not delete any existing readings.
