# Setup

The setup process is relatively straightforward, but there are a few things to be aware of. 

The only piece of information that you the application cannot provide is your smart meter IHD ID. This is a 12-digit number that is printed on the back of the smart meter IHD.

Your energy meter MPAN/MPRN numbers are also required, but these can be obtained through the National Grid lookup service [supplier.nationalgrid.co.uk](https://supplier.nationalgrid.co.uk/) 
and findmysupplier.energy: [findmysupplier.energy](https://www.findmysupplier.energy).
