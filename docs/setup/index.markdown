# Setup

The setup process is relatively straightforward, but there are a few things to be aware of. 

The only piece of information that you the application cannot provide is your smart meter IHD MAC ID. This is a 12-digit number that is often printed on the back of the smart meter IHD, but sometimes it can be found within the user interface of the IHD. 

A useful page with help for finding your IHD MAC ID is provided by howz.com: [howz.com/mac](https://www.howz.com/mac)

Your energy meter MPAN/MPRN numbers are also required, but these can be obtained through the National Grid lookup service [supplier.nationalgrid.co.uk](https://supplier.nationalgrid.co.uk/) for electricity meters and [findmysupplier.energy](https://www.findmysupplier.energy) for gas meters.
