# Gas Meter Setup

If you have a Gas Meter is a smart meter, which most in the UK are, you can enter the Gas Meter MPRN number here. If you don't have a Gas Meter hasn't been set up as a smart meter (for example, you still have your readings manually read by a technician), you can't use the application with your Gas meter. 

You can still use the application with your Electricity meter.

### Gas Meter MPRN

An MPRN is a Meter Point Reference Number, which is a unique number that identifies your Gas Meter.

You can find your Gas Meter MPRN number on your energy bill, or by using the link to the findmysupplier.energy website.

Enter your MPRN number and click save. The MPRN number is checked to ensure that it is valid. If you enter an invalid MPRN number, a warning will show and it won't be saved. If for some reason your cannot validate your MPRN number, you won't be able to use the application with your Gas Meter, but you can still use it with your Electricity meter.

Once you have entered and saved your Gas meter details, a green *Authorize* button will be enabled to proceed to authorize the meter with n3rgy.
