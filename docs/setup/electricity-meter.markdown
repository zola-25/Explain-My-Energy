# Electricity Meter Setup

If you have an Electricity Meter is a smart meter, which most in the UK are, you can enter the Electricity Meter MPAN number here. If you don't have an Electricity Meter hasn't been set up as a smart meter (for example, you still have your readings manually read by a technician), you can't use the application with your Electricity meter.

You can still use the application with your Gas meter.

### Electricity Meter MPAN

An MPAN is a Meter Point Administration Number, which is a unique number that identifies your Electricity Meter.

Whereas Gas Meters as designated by Meter Point Reference Numbers (MPRNs), Electricity Meters are designated by Meter Point Administration Numbers (MPANs). 

You can find your Electricity Meter MPAN number on your energy bill. Alternatively you can use the embedded link to show the National Grid lookup service, where you can enter your postcode and house number to find your MPAN number. 

If you find embedded link for the National Grid lookup service difficult to use, or poorly displayed on a small screen, you can click *Open in separate tab* to open the lookup service in a separate browser tab.

The MPAN number is checked to ensure that it is valid, and that it is an Electricity meter. If you enter an invalid MPAN number, you will be prompted to re-enter it. Just like Gas Meter MPRNs, MPANs have a fixed format, so it's easy to check that the number is valid. If you enter an invalid MPAN number, a warning will show and it won't possible to save your Electricity Meter. 

If for some reason your cannot validate your MPAN number, you won't be able to use the application with your Electricity Meter, but you can still use it with your Gas meter.

Once you have entered and saved your Electricity meter MPAN, a green *Authorize* button will be enabled to proceed to authorize the meter with n3rgy.
