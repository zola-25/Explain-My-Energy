# App Setup Status

The App Setup Status table shows the current state of the application setup. It can be viewed on the home page, and is also displayed at the end of the Setup Wizard process.

It shows: 

- **Household Setup:** Whether the Household details have been entered and saved. This is always the necessary first step in the setup process.

- **Electricity and Gas Meter Setup:** Which meters have been added and authorized, and which meters are still to be setup.

- **Electricity and Gas Meter Readings:** Whether the meter readings have been retrieved and analyzed for each meter, or if they may be lacking up to date readings. It will also report if the costed readings have been calculated for the meter, or if they are not up to date.

- **Electricity and Gas Historical Forecasts:** If the historical forecast readings have been calculated for each meter, issues preventing the historical forecast readings from being calculated, or if the historical forecast readings are not up to date.


- **Temperature-dependent Forecasts:** If the temperature-dependent forecast readings have been calculated for the heating meter (usually the gas meter, and the one that was set up as the 'Primary Heating Source' in the Household setup). It can also report back some issues that may be preventing the forecast readings from being calculated.
