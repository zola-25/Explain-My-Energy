Explain My Energy is a hobby project built from the ashes of a startup that didn't quite make it to version 1.0. The goal is to provide a free, simple, easy to use tool for understanding your energy usage, forecasting future costs and seeing how seasonal temperature changes can affect your energy bill.

The source code for this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/zola-25/Explain-My-Energy)

A live version of the site is available at [explainmyenergy.com](https://explainmyenergy.com)

For a pre-configured example example setup, see [demo.explainmyenergy.com](https://demo.explainmyenergy.com)
