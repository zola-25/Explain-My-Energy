    <strong>Explain my Energy</strong> is a tool to help you understand your existing energy bills and anticipate when and how much they might change.
    <br />
    <br />

    It is designed to be used by anyone, as long as you have a smart meter (it doesn't even have to be working).
    <br />
    <br />
    We use your historical energy usage, your energy tariff details and local weather data to show you:
    <br />
    <br />


    1) How much your recent bills have been, and future energy bills will be
    <br />

    2) How much your spending changes as outside temperatures change  - and allowing you change the forecast to see it effects your bills.
    <br />
    <br />

    And that's alongside powerful charting tools that allow you to see everything from granular hourly energy spikes, to whole seasonal energy costs, simply with a mouse scroll (or a swipe).
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />


    We don't sell energy, we don't sell your data, we don't even store your data.<br />
    We're using the latest web browser technology to bring you a tool that is fast, secure and private.<br />
    All your data is stored and processed locally on your device; we don't even know it exists. <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    And that's just version 1.0. With AI becoming more mainstream, we'll be looking add more features that really tailor recommendations to you and your home.<br />
    We're hoping you'll join us on this journey. If you have any comments or suggestions, please email us at <a href="mailto:TODO@TODO.com" />
