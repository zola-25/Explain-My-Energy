    <p ><strong>Explain My Energy</strong> is a free, open-source tool to help you understand both your existing energy bills and your future energy costs and consumption.</p>
    <p >It is designed to be used by anyone, as long as you have a smart meter (it doesn't even have to be working).</p>
    <p >The application uses your historical energy usage, your energy tariff details and local weather data to give you:</p>
    <ul class="ml-3">
        <li>Detailed breakdowns of your historical, current and future energy costs and consumption</li>
        <li>How much your costs change with weather changes - change the forecast, and see how much your energy usage spikes (or drops) </li>
        <li>Powerful charting tools that allow you to see everything from granular hourly energy spikes, to whole seasonal energy costs, simply with a mouse scroll (or a swipe)</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <p><strong>Explain My Energy</strong> doesn't sell energy; doesn't sell your data; it doesn't collect your data.</p>
    <p >There is no sign up, no login, no cookies, no tracking, no ads.</p>
    <p >It uses the latest web browser technology to store and process everything on your device. </p>

    <p>This is an initial <strong>beta version</strong> of the application. Feedback is much appreciated and will help determine whether the app provides enough value to warrant maintaining and developing further.</p>
    <p> Advancements in AI offer interesting possibilities - tailored energy advice unique to each individual and their home, for example.</p>
